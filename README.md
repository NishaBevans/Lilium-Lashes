Whilst still in development, this is a fully functional and carefully crafted starter webpage for the salon Lilium Lashes. Created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript, the site was built from the ground up to support my sister’s growing beauty business while also serving as a meaningful showcase of my progress as a full-stack software engineer. The website features a modern, responsive design with a fully styled booking system, a dynamic availability calendar, form validation, and seamless appointment handling through EmailJS integration. Clients can book appointments directly online, receive instant confirmations, and soon they’ll be able to explore a visual gallery highlighting lash extension styles and the stylist's portfolio. Hosted on Netlify for smooth deployment, this site will receive routine updates with fresh content, visual enhancements, and additional functionality as both the business and my skillset evolve.
